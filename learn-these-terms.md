# Terms to learn!
## 27/04/2023, Lodurs Technologies
Hello! If you are coming to our team, or even trying to, you must understand these terms first!



# Discord

## Discord User Tag
Discord-application's user tags, is account's identification system. There is no other user with same name and tag as you! Discord Tags must have a certain name, like "Vipe" or "MOD | Vipe" and in the end must be a "#" and four digits (numbers). Like "#" and "0001" so in total, it would be something like "Vipe#0001".



## Discord User ID
Discord also uses a ID system for everything. Channels, roles, servers, emojis, messages, users and even slash commands. So, these means something. User ID is 16-Digits (numbers), like something, "1091632451769614447". In our services, we will use these IDs as well. To mention a user, you use "<@" as prefix and "1091632451769614447" as content, and ">" as ending. So in total it would be "<@1091632451769614447>" and by sending that in any place, it will change to mentioning of that user. Like this one will be "Vipe#0001".


# Websites

Now you have abilities to learn some things from Websites, like domains and more. While we are teaching you stuff about domains, we will speak about "https://en.lodurs.com/docs/terms-of-service.html"

## HTTPS, HTTP or LOCAL:

HTTPS and HTTP stands for Hypertext Transforming Protocol (Secure). It basically means that the HTML files will be displayed in web browser (HTML = HyperText Markup Language). Local means a file inside your laptop, but it is not yet in internet. Local locations is C: or 127.0.0.1. C: is called path, and 127.0.0.1 is computer's localhost. In computer networking, localhost is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access it
