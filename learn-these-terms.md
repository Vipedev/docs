# Terms to learn!

Hello! If you are coming to our team, or even trying to, you must understand these terms first!



# Discord

## Discord User Tag
Discord-application's user tags, is account's identification system. There is no other user with same name and tag as you! Discord Tags must have a certain name, like "Vipe" or "MOD | Vipe" and in the end must be a "#" and four digits (numbers). Like "#" and "0001" so in total, it would be something like "Vipe#0001".



## Discord User ID
Discord also uses a ID system for everything. Channels, roles, servers, emojis, messages, users and even slash commands. So, these means something. User ID is 16-Digits (numbers), like something, "1091632451769614447". In our services, we will use these IDs as well. To mention a user, you use "<@" as prefix and "1091632451769614447" as content, and ">" as ending. So in total it would be "<@1091632451769614447>" and by sending that in any place, it will change to mentioning of that user. Like this one will be "Vipe#0001".


# Websites

## Domain, Subdomain, URL, and TLD
In website service we know a few terms as well. First one is domain. Domain is the base Uniform Resource Locator, alias "URL". These are usually called links. The link may be something like "docs.lodurs.com" and here the main domain is the "lodurs.com". Full domain is separated in multiple different parts. Heres a example:
"https://docs.lodurs.com/support/domain/index.html" So the parts is something like "HTTPS" as "Hypertext Transfer Protocol (Secure)" aka "HTTP" or "HTTPS".. Sub Domains like something before the main page's domain. Like "docs". so now it is "https://docs", now the main domain content, is the url's base. The heading website. Like in this situation, it is "lodurs". "https://docs.lodurs".. Now we need to get a Top Level Domain. which is something like ".com" or ".net". It's also known as "TLD". "https://docs.lodurs.com".. So now it will go where we've asked it to go. But the actual whole domain keeps getting longer. The location where to go, is the folder's page. It's a thing like "folder" slash for separate, "/", and then the file for "page" or a new folder.. So it's like "folder/folder" or "folder/page".. Now it is "https://docs.lodurs.com/support/domain/". Now In our full domain, it will be called as " https://docs.lodurs.com/support/domain/index". Something missing? Yes, the file type is missing. To make it as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) you add a .html at the end. Here we are, "https://docs.lodurs.com/support/domain/index.html".
